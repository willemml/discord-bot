#+title: Discord Bot

A simple Discord bot.
I started this project to explore the Discord API through rust crates (serenity-rs).

** Features

- "dice roller" roll up to 10 dice of your choice at once (up to 20 sides)
- "auto reply" scan all incoming messages for a regex match, reply with the configured string if there is a match
